# Gamma Browser
A basic browser written in PyQt and utilizing Qt Web Engine.
Contains: 1 shell script for launch, desktop entry, one .py file (the browser itself) and an icon
Directories:
Shell script: /etc/gamma-browser.sh
Desktop entry: /usr/share/applications/gamma-browser.desktop
Browser itself: /usr/bin/browser.py
Icon: /usr/share/icons/gamma.ico
The browser's very basic, not letting you to download stuff, doesn't have settings menu (if not to edit the .py file), can't start search from the address bar (if something like "Taylor Swift" is just entered, it demands for a URL address), and many other features I won't be able to realize due to my dull knowledge of PyQt and Python itself. So, I hope there will be a little community that'll love to help it grow.
Respect, E.G.
